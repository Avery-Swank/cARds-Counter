# cARds-Counter
cARds Counter is an Augmented Reality mobile application used to project card information ontop of traditional playing cards. In the game of blackjack, there is the idea of counting cards where the player has the advantage over the dealer if there is a ratio of more high cards than low cards in a deck of cards. cARds projects card counting information on the playing cards and keeps a running count of how many cards have passed through the camera.
